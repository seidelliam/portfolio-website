Just wanted to make some notes for next time:
    - Go through and fix issues with margins FIRST
    - Plan out what info can go on the website and where
        - If there isn't a lot, thing about what design types work best for that
        - If there is, same thing
    - Look at other websites for some inspiration
    -Think about a cool opening transition to open the page, especially if you make the page scrollable
- For a intro transition, think about a knockoff Netflix (vertical line, split and open page)


To-Do:
1. Figure out why the navbar is dissappearing at the bottom of the page
2. Add in real project to figure out grid layout and display method
3. Do research on ::after
4. (optional) Set navbar animation to happen when scroll down to next page
